# An example demo app created with Electron and MySQL 

This example demo is accompanying this tutorial on Techiediaries 

[5+ Ways to Persist Data in Node.js/Electron Apps](https://www.techiediaries.com/electron-data-persistence/)

Make sure to read the tutorial to see the pros and cons related to using MySQL+ plain SQL to persist 
data in Electron apps and also the other alternatives that you can use instead of this approach if you are looking 
for other options.

This example desktop app makes use of the following web technologies and tools:

* Electron
* MySQL Node.js module for connecting Node.js apps to MySQL database system 
* Angular.js 1.x JavaScript framework to structure the application code

The example demonstrates how to do CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations against a MySQL database.
It provides also a simple pagination system to paginate data.    

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.


You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start).
